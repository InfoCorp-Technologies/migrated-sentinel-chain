# SENC Token Smart Contracts

The crowdsale will be conducted on Ethereum’s blockchain and will involve 4 smart contracts:

<br />

## Whitelist Contract
The Whitelist contract will contain the list of all whitelisted contributor’s Ethereum wallet address, 
allocation as well as the group that the contributor is being assigned to. Each contributor will be assigned 
a group number that corresponds to the time that the contributor can start purchasing. 

## Token Contract
The SENC Token contract is a ERC20-compatible token that is designed to be non-transferrable until the Vesting 
contract has been activated. The SENC Tokens will only be available for transfer by public 3 days before listing 
on the first exchange. Token also facilitates airdrop to a group of recipients as long as the contract has sufficient 
balance.

## Sale Contract
The Sale contract is organized as follows according to the whitepaper:
- 20% (100,000,000 SENC) of total supply will be minted and sent to a single early supporter wallet address.
- 30% (150,000,000) of total supply will be minted and sent to a single treasury wallet address.
- 10% (50,000,000) of total supply will be minted and sent to a single founding team wallet.
- 20% (100,000,000) of total supply will be minted and sent to a single presale wallet address.
- 20% (100,000,000) of total supply will be available for minting and purchase by public.
Tokens are non-transferrable in these wallets and can only be unlocked by the Vesting contract.

## Vesting Contract
The Vesting Contract will control the distribution of the release of tokens using the following conditions:
- Pre-sale and Early Supporters
  - Receives 25% of their purchased tokens once the contract is activated.
  - Receives 25% of their purchased tokens subsequently after every 4 weeks (3x) 
- Founding Team
  - Receives 20% of their awarded tokens once the contract is activated.
  - Receives 20% of their awarded tokens subsequently after every 24 weeks (4x)
